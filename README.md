# Prototype CDSS Engine (Experimental)

** work in progress, check back later **

Repository for testing backend components for an experimental knowledge base-backed engine of a clinical decision support system for human health risk for space travel. This work integrates an experimental knowledge graph describing human health risk for space travel and uses it to fine tune an LLM. We are using Jlama, a Java-based interface for LLM. See complementary repos in this project for the knowledge graph.
